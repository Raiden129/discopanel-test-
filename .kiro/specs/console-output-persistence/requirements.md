# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Minecraft server management panel currently has a critical console functionality issue where commands executed via rconn (remote console connection) display their output only briefly before disappearing. This creates a poor user experience as administrators cannot see the results of their commands, making server management and debugging extremely difficult. This feature will implement a solution to capture, persist, and display rconn command output in the console interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to see the output of console commands I execute through the web panel, so that I can verify command execution and troubleshoot server issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user executes a command via the web console THEN the system SHALL capture the command output from rconn
2. WHEN command output is captured THEN the system SHALL persist the output in the console display
3. WHEN output is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the output visibility until manually cleared or scrolled away
4. WHEN multiple commands are executed THEN the system SHALL display outputs in chronological order
5. IF a command produces no output THEN the system SHALL indicate successful execution with a status message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the console to distinguish between different types of output, so that I can quickly identify command results versus server logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying rconn command output THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish it from regular server stdout logs
2. WHEN a command is executed THEN the system SHALL display the original command alongside its output
3. WHEN output is displayed THEN the system SHALL include timestamps for command execution
4. IF output contains error messages THEN the system SHALL highlight errors with appropriate styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the console output to be reliable and consistent, so that I can trust the information displayed for server management decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rconn commands are executed THEN the system SHALL capture output without interfering with normal server operation
2. WHEN output is captured THEN the system SHALL handle both successful command responses and error messages
3. WHEN the console interface is refreshed THEN the system SHALL maintain recent command history and output
4. IF rconn connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
5. WHEN output is very long THEN the system SHALL handle large responses without breaking the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the console to perform well even with frequent command usage, so that the management interface remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN capturing command output THEN the system SHALL not significantly impact server performance
2. WHEN displaying output THEN the system SHALL limit console history to prevent memory issues
3. WHEN console reaches maximum history THEN the system SHALL remove oldest entries automatically
4. IF output capture fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking console functionality
